###### This repository contains some examples for the new features introuced in Java 8, such as:

 * **Default Methods**
 * **Method References**
 * **Lambdas**
 * **Streaming API**
 * **Time API**
 
###### You can get Java 8 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

###### The source code for all examples can be found in the directory src/main/java/com/sayem

###### I'm adding new samples from time to time, but feel free to fork and try it yourself.
